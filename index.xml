      <description>lots of headway, the time for release draws nearer. stupid things tripping me up lately, but i guess it&amp;rsquo;s all part of the process. today for example, i learned trigger events will still register for disabled colliders and even if the whole gameObject is disabled.</description>

      <description>idk if the new regiment is increasing or decreasing my productivity. i am still getting things checked off, but it is difficult to gauge whether or not it is an improvement honestly, i&amp;rsquo;m not even sure i&amp;rsquo;ve followed it at all this week; but it is good to still have a general idea of the direction i should be moving</description>

      <description>yeah, all that stuff rolled into one. we&amp;rsquo;ll see how long it can last without me starting to feel like a waste-case. the original plan was for a month long duration, April 10th through May, however my FF7R shipment didn&amp;rsquo;t arrive on time so I got off to a bit of a late start, hahah.</description>

      <description>i keep going back and forth between feeling really accomplished and totally unproductive. can my disposition be attributed to the current pandemic the world faces? who knows? the level stat bonuses and currency collection actually add a refreshing dynamic to the game loop and drive the player to perform other behaviors than just attack and dodge.</description>

      <description>long time, no entry&amp;hellip; at least not a proper one. still working on the map, it is almost complete, or at least functional having a few issues when hopping in and out of levels, couple values not being reset properly&amp;hellip; but all the core operability i was worried about seems to be working&amp;hellip; just needs a few tweaks the info system i made from the modal panel seems to be working.</description>

      <description>a world map is a map of the world, so i guess i&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the worlds map&amp;hellip; a map of the worlds, heh i have been worrying about it quit a bit and luckily it looks like once again Unity has some magic up its sleeve.</description>

      <description>restart or retry means you redo kinda laughing a bit at that line here. before it just kind of restarted the spawn loop, reset your position and healed you up. now, any experience you obtained while playing the stage is lost when you either manually restart the level, or die and try agsin funny that it took as much effort as it did, perhaps that is a symptom of modern gamedev&amp;hellip; some strange snafu when something oft considered an aged, old fashioned type of mechanic or functionality is actually harder to implement than a more sophisticated mainstream approach a time worn game rule: you die; you go back.</description>

      <description>seems like destroying the persistent player on the loading screen when returning to the title screen solved the issue i was having with the modal window as a bonus, it appears that when i was working through all the ADB errors yesterday trying everything i could, i fixed a few bugs i had no idea how to tackle not sure how i should proceed tomorrow.</description>

      <description>i kinda feel like i am continually fixing the same problems over and over maybe thats just what development feels like? i can&amp;rsquo;t really be sure yet, the process is still rather new to me i hope with experience, i learn to write more easily extensible code.</description>

      <description>been pretty chaotic lately managed to get the level system growth curve implementation going&amp;hellip; only the experience is working currently, but the stats should be much the same i&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the data structure I was working on for saving level progress is going to work&amp;hellip; I should probably look into serializing the scriptable object itself instead of copying the relevant info into a class specifically for saving restarting the level picks up from the correct iteration now and the quit button has a map and gameplay context.</description>

      <description>finishing up a bit early today, due to it being a good stopping point and that i am satisfied with my progress. it wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly a full day, but some of the changes were pretty big, as far as helpfulness and consideration, even if they were small in terms of effort or actual work.</description>

      <description>things got crazy toward the end of the week, so i am posting what was meant to be Friday&amp;rsquo;s entree a day backdated. i went from thinking i had irrevocably broken things and having to loose a week&amp;rsquo;s worth or so of work from going in the wrong direction, to almost getting the exact functionality i was looking for.</description>

      <description>only halfway through the day i found so many problems with the code i posted yesterday more restructuring today created a WorldLevel class to hold level information, such as the level spawn position texture, a level complete bool and a ScriptableObject array for that level&amp;rsquo;s dialogue all this rework comes with implementing save functionality fully.</description>

      <description>more structural changes and minor fixes began the final implementations of the data saving system refactored the player&amp;rsquo;s level system a bit so the design makes more sense and will be more workable in the future it is now directly accessible from the player script, as opposed to being handled by the game controller.</description>

      <description>got the back and forth working with the game and dialogue controllers. still needs a bit of refining.
essentially i used a black pixel (for now) in the level spawn texture to trigger conversations from an array of scriptable objects.</description>

      <description>i have resumed work on the game for the year. today was hard.
at first, it seemed like the house of cards i have slowly been building was collapsing before my very eyes; but then it all started to make sense again.</description>

      <description>been taking the weekends off fairly consistently as of late. although that does not necessarily mean not working on the game, although it technically kinda does.
this may seem confusing, but i have been using the weekends for inspiration and learning.</description>

      <description>so i decided it was time for dialogue in my the game. seeing as how ive been coding everything from the ground up, i naturally looked toward this approach again. a bit of explanation is probably in order here.</description>

      <description>so many great suggestions already and only one tester!
creating with Unity gives me the freedom to design the game systems any way I want, but hearing straight up from another gamer what would be cooler in terms of design is amazing.</description>

      <description>big steps!
implemented Google Play Games Services for the game, the only thing left to add in is cloud save. did it all surprisingly quickly; so far it has taken less than a week, granted the instructions i&amp;rsquo;m following say it should take about an hour.</description>

      <description>a full circle strange sort of things occuring lately
attempting to go fully procedural for the planet creation with the help of a great series by Sabastain Lague. in retrospect, even though i have slowly been discovering the many benefits of working procedurally, i didnt exactly know this sort of thing was possible directly in Unity without some sort of third party implementation.</description>

this seem to zip, whoosh and click when i am programming; but DCC is a completely different animal, almost a hostile one&amp;hellip; a hostile sloth, if there is such a thing.</description>

      <description>the new monitors look great and overall I am happy with my decision to buy them. still getting the proper position and angle nailed down; first time ever having two displays that match, so it kinda feels like i have to shift over, rather than turn my head, if the position isn&amp;rsquo;t just right.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I am slipping or if the learning curve just ramped itself up. been following an excellent set of lessons and have been trying to refactor and comment a bit as i go; i thought it would help me understand how complex systems like the ones I&amp;rsquo;m used to interacting with in just about every game I like, are created and designed.</description>

      <description>i can&amp;rsquo;t believe its been a week and this model isn&amp;rsquo;t retopologized yet. to be fair, i lost a few days this week to unexpected circumstances, but i really thought it could be done by today and i am still working on topology&amp;hellip; when topology doesn&amp;rsquo;t even matter.</description>

      <description>cannot believe this is all i really got done today! kinda upset about it. was having a lot of issues getting meshes to decimate. they would either disappear or start to blink randomly when viewed from certain angles.</description>

      <description>finished the painting and sculpting i needed to do in zBrush, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t much. my zBrush phase now consists of: vertex painting material IDs for Substance Painter, making sure the various forms and layering of subtools are watertight for retopology in Topogun with the good &amp;lsquo;ol move brush, and lastly, decimating everything into a more bitesized polygon count and merging it all into a single subtool.</description>

today I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much either. spent some time studying up on things i will need to know later, like data persistence and started the first boss model.</description>
