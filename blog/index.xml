      <description>reintroduced the coding for difficulty setting and programmed a play time clock, so that I can finally see how long the gameplay itself is added the ticker to the menu and save file displays, although doing so required rebuilding a bit of the player&amp;rsquo;s prefab and animator graph.</description>

      <description>something I did broke the save system, not really sure what exactly, so I&amp;rsquo;ve backed everything up as it was broken and am restoring last week&amp;rsquo;s backup, which seems to work.</description>

      <description>after a bit of first hand experience during my time away from the project with difficulty level, I have decided that a traditional system is indeed needed for my own game.</description>

      <description>it had been awhile since I modeled a human from scratch, so I started one to use as the final boss; shake things up a bit from the machines. progress is going smoothly, mainly because my references seem to be well crafted added a skip button for the dialogue, in case people like to die quickly and numerously.</description>

      <description>what a rough day i remember it being tricky to go back and forth between scripting backend types (mono, IL2CPP) and needing the internet to do so, but I don&amp;rsquo;t recall having so many problems!</description>

      <description>no, seriously&amp;hellip; i think this might help all of it needs to be done anyhow mayhap a month of dreary upkeep and a return to the masses of the online roleplayers be just what the doctor ordered i should real quick build a three kit kill version for test play during this time, the level progression values as is are definitely off-putting</description>

      <description>i am formally declaring (announcing?) the conclusion of operation: octo-squid. while the operation&amp;rsquo;s primary objectives will remain in place, i feel that the short-term goal the regimen was put in place to achieve has been accomplished for the time being.</description>

      <description>i can feel the pangs of art beginning to return after a month or so of respite. i think i shall try to ease myself back into the actual creative parts by working on some practical aspects, that have been neglected as of late, to begin.</description>

      <description>spent the whole week painting textures and creating shaders for the big attack for the primary attack of the second boss. had some issues with photoshop&amp;rsquo;s recognition of my wacom tablets pressure sensitivity, it was weird and I could have swore it was working.</description>

      <description>finally started setting up the second boss, it is tougher going than I had anticipated. for whatever reason, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I gave as much consideration beforehand to exactly how this particular boss would articulate what its possible attack patterns may be I then began to realise I hadn&amp;rsquo;t decided where either of the remaining two boss&amp;rsquo; weaknesses were going to be located either.</description>

      <description>finished texturing the third boss ship model in substance painter and exported the textures. still need to setup the shaders and do the final FBX export from Maya i can&amp;rsquo;t decide if i want to continue to do the attack animations in Unity, or go a bit ahead and learn the animation and rigging pipeline, so i would already have it under my belt when i go to animate a humanoid character or anything else with a complex rig hierarchy i&amp;rsquo;d obviously want to animate in Maya hmm, indeed</description>

      <description>finished laying out the base colors for boss ship 3 in zbrush, still need to paint the decals and decimate also think the weapon effect system is working, managed to figure out a way to set the default effect when unequipping a weapon altogether, which of course wasn&amp;rsquo;t as difficult of a problem as it seemed to be, once i had written the code supposed to test the stage progression system a bit this weekend, maybe i should add in a third type first&amp;hellip; it is good to be feeling motivated again!</description>

      <description>my birthday vacation seems to have inadvertently become a summer stay, either that or I&amp;rsquo;ve reached a slump. slowly, but surely i am finding fresh motive to continue.
there was a bit of a temporary detour in attempt to get better internet infrastructure in my home, but in the end my efforts have proven fruitless.</description>

      <description>so, almost done with my month long birthday break it officially began april 23 to play the Nier remake, still did a few things during it though edited the spawn textures for world 0, section 1 to adjust for difficulty need to start modeling items and get on with it</description>

      <description>ended up swapping to Maya halfway through retopologizing this model. sections started to get really close together, even having tried to eliminate such areas in the modeling stage i feel as though i have discovered this before, but the new Maya modeling toolkit is actually better than using TopoGun.</description>

had some strange issues merging subtools in z&amp;hellip; ended up reloading a save to find a piece disappearing and reappearing, sort of flickering as the camera would rotate.</description>

      <description>added logic for resetting the player&amp;rsquo;s inventory/equipment on death to the state it was when the stage began my first thoughts were to add the items consumed to a list when used, then add them back into the inventory on retry, but through further consideration i realised there would be issues with equipment and that i should probably save/restore that along with the inventory.</description>

      <description>you&amp;rsquo;d think this sort if thing would be more obvious from a design standpoint, but it&amp;rsquo;s the kind of thing you need to learn first hand or have previous experience, i guess anyway, after questioning the entire health orb mechanic now that healing inventory items work, i came to the conclusion the drop conditions should just be adjusted.</description>

      <description>i am writing this the morning of the fourth day actually, topology always takes more time than i plan for. i managed to get the model itself done, but it is still lacking UVWs the plan for today is just to get them done, maybe i will make it as far as to bring the model into substance painter to bake the base maps and check for projection errors.</description>

      <description>currently stopped again from thunder, model approximately 2/3 done. i wonder how much concern is warranted and how much is paranoia in regard to lightning frying electronics i keep reminding myself to just get the mesh out as quickly as possible and that i will still optimize it in maya before laying out the UVW, but it is hard to altogether keep myself from considering topology.</description>

      <description>got the ship into zBrush and have started remeshing the pieces i need to sculpt/paint on; the sound of looming thunder has thwarted my progress once more, for now. i can definitely feel my years of experience paying off with zBrush.</description>

      <description>lots of headway, the time for release draws nearer. stupid things tripping me up lately, but i guess it&amp;rsquo;s all part of the process. today for example, i learned trigger events will still register for disabled colliders and even if the whole gameObject is disabled.</description>

      <description>yeah, all that stuff rolled into one. we&amp;rsquo;ll see how long it can last without me starting to feel like a waste-case. the original plan was for a month long duration, April 10th through May, however my FF7R shipment didn&amp;rsquo;t arrive on time so I got off to a bit of a late start, hahah.</description>

      <description>i keep going back and forth between feeling really accomplished and totally unproductive. can my disposition be attributed to the current pandemic the world faces? who knows? the level stat bonuses and currency collection actually add a refreshing dynamic to the game loop and drive the player to perform other behaviors than just attack and dodge.</description>

      <description>restart or retry means you redo kinda laughing a bit at that line here. before it just kind of restarted the spawn loop, reset your position and healed you up. now, any experience you obtained while playing the stage is lost when you either manually restart the level, or die and try agsin funny that it took as much effort as it did, perhaps that is a symptom of modern gamedev&amp;hellip; some strange snafu when something oft considered an aged, old fashioned type of mechanic or functionality is actually harder to implement than a more sophisticated mainstream approach a time worn game rule: you die; you go back.</description>

      <description>been pretty chaotic lately managed to get the level system growth curve implementation going&amp;hellip; only the experience is working currently, but the stats should be much the same i&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the data structure I was working on for saving level progress is going to work&amp;hellip; I should probably look into serializing the scriptable object itself instead of copying the relevant info into a class specifically for saving restarting the level picks up from the correct iteration now and the quit button has a map and gameplay context.</description>

      <description>things got crazy toward the end of the week, so i am posting what was meant to be Friday&amp;rsquo;s entree a day backdated. i went from thinking i had irrevocably broken things and having to loose a week&amp;rsquo;s worth or so of work from going in the wrong direction, to almost getting the exact functionality i was looking for.</description>

      <description>only halfway through the day i found so many problems with the code i posted yesterday more restructuring today created a WorldLevel class to hold level information, such as the level spawn position texture, a level complete bool and a ScriptableObject array for that level&amp;rsquo;s dialogue all this rework comes with implementing save functionality fully.</description>

      <description>more structural changes and minor fixes began the final implementations of the data saving system refactored the player&amp;rsquo;s level system a bit so the design makes more sense and will be more workable in the future it is now directly accessible from the player script, as opposed to being handled by the game controller.</description>

      <description>corrected the loading issue i had, as well as one with the menu/back button; it should work for every case now. then i got a bit distracted maybe, maybe not&amp;hellip; i needed more music anyway, but it felt like it took too long to make or something.</description>

      <description>went back to original loading screen code, for the most part. tried to optimize and consolidate different methods for fading scenes. still feel like i am loosing frames during the loading process, at this point i no clue which code has better performance.</description>

      <description>totally off course, but what the hey; perfect example of why i&amp;rsquo;ll probably never finish the game. maybe i needed a break from the regiment, a slight deviation from the plan.</description>

      <description>hard day today started out fixing a few trickle down effect issues from restructuring I&amp;rsquo;ve inadvertently been going through this week. also shortened the tutorial further, trying to make it more concise removed the command character, thought maybe I&amp;rsquo;d save him for the appearance of the first live enemies seemed overly complex to stop the spawn loop on player death</description>

      <description>spent this entire week reworking the overall layout of my UI. i am really not sure if this new approach is more performant, but after taking the holiday break and looking at the structure of my project with new eyes, it feels like a more organized way of doing things (see subject).</description>

      <description>fixed the need for manual line returns by reworking the dialogue controller a bit based on a video made by textmeshpro. took a few hours to make it work and a lot of experimentation, but it works and the code doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel hacky.</description>

      <description>got the back and forth working with the game and dialogue controllers. still needs a bit of refining.
essentially i used a black pixel (for now) in the level spawn texture to trigger conversations from an array of scriptable objects.</description>

creating with Unity gives me the freedom to design the game systems any way I want, but hearing straight up from another gamer what would be cooler in terms of design is amazing.</description>

implemented Google Play Games Services for the game, the only thing left to add in is cloud save. did it all surprisingly quickly; so far it has taken less than a week, granted the instructions i&amp;rsquo;m following say it should take about an hour.</description>

attempting to go fully procedural for the planet creation with the help of a great series by Sabastain Lague. in retrospect, even though i have slowly been discovering the many benefits of working procedurally, i didnt exactly know this sort of thing was possible directly in Unity without some sort of third party implementation.</description>

      <description>things have been really hard going these last few days. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I am slipping or if the learning curve just ramped itself up. been following an excellent set of lessons and have been trying to refactor and comment a bit as i go; i thought it would help me understand how complex systems like the ones I&amp;rsquo;m used to interacting with in just about every game I like, are created and designed.</description>

      <description>i can&amp;rsquo;t believe its been a week and this model isn&amp;rsquo;t retopologized yet. to be fair, i lost a few days this week to unexpected circumstances, but i really thought it could be done by today and i am still working on topology&amp;hellip; when topology doesn&amp;rsquo;t even matter.</description>

      <description>finished the painting and sculpting i needed to do in zBrush, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t much. my zBrush phase now consists of: vertex painting material IDs for Substance Painter, making sure the various forms and layering of subtools are watertight for retopology in Topogun with the good &amp;lsquo;ol move brush, and lastly, decimating everything into a more bitesized polygon count and merging it all into a single subtool.</description>

      <description>being lazy doesn&amp;rsquo;t pay off. i thought i could take a shortcut by using Unity&amp;rsquo;s new LWRP and Shader Graph for animating materials but it turned into a long cut. had nasty lighting seams all over my models.</description>

      <description>so, i guess you really do need containing edges everywhere you have an extreme angle. this second ship, i went a little less liberal with the edge count and i wound up with projection errors.</description>

      <description>i have begun work on the first of what will probably be many enemy spaceship models.
it always takes longer than expected. i thought this would be a simple one, but working with only an aerial reference leads to quite a lot of figuring in the other two dimensions.</description>

      <description>took longer than i would have expected to generate the user interface sprites for the movement controller in my game, but it is done and it works well.
i rendered it from 3D in Maya to make it look nice and consequently had to learn some of the new nodes the Arnold renderer uses.</description>

      <description>for whatever reason, getting the editor to see my device (Pixel 2) on the Unity Remote app is a bit clumsy, at best. i&amp;rsquo;m not really too sure how i even got it to work.</description>

      <description>been doing a lot of inadvertent research into newer character production pipelines than i am familiar with. i feel i have been stagnant for too long and my workflow was possibly dated before i learnt it in college, so progress is progress.</description>

      <description>had a little problem trying a new technique that seemed solid beforehand. i needed some asteroids for the project so, thinking it would be a fairly simple model, i thought to try a little change-up in my workflow in attempt to expedite the process.</description>

      <description>unless ive done something wrong in my testing; which is quite possible, it is not only unnecessary but will yield poorer results to not utilize mikktspace inside unity.
to summarize, for my own notes:</description>

      <description>been doing a series of tests regarding how to properly compute tangents between unity and substance painter.
thought i had everything figured out until i realized some information i was referencing was slightly out of date.</description>
