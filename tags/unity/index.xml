      <description>i guess the machine learning seminar i took got me thinking started playing with the ML-Agents package in Unity. idk if I am hoping I can somehow program robots to finish the game for me, or if I am just bored and needed some new influx of input it is definitely intriguing and I&amp;rsquo;m surprised how quickly the agents could outperform me.</description>

      <description>been working on the boss ship 2 model, hi-res almost done changed out my learning.regiment from Unity&amp;rsquo;s artificial intelligence course to an intro to the ML-Agents package, the hummingbirds. it seems to incorporate new solutions to traditional AI problems, which should keep my brain seeking and growing, while potentially finding some new behavior for an enemy or possibly balancing out some mechanics for the game time will tell, but i feel the influx of new ideas, practices and technologies to be crucial to developing</description>

      <description>i feel like i&amp;rsquo;ve lost weeks! in actuality, it&amp;rsquo;s probably been about a week&amp;hellip; in total, over the course of several weeks, but i still feel behind i&amp;rsquo;ve done numerous things and added functionality that has been on my list for a long time, but i feel like i&amp;rsquo;m really just avoiding the most pressing concern of modeling more stuff, namely the second boss i did add models for different ore items for selling and did some further delving into the shader graph, to get a more appealing metallic material with just a bit of fresnel from the graph.</description>

      <description>two steps forward and three steps back. seems like every time i fix something, i break it later. why must this be? more problems unequipping things&amp;hellip; at least i finally replicated the issue; it will only occur on the first stage.</description>

      <description>you&amp;rsquo;d think this sort if thing would be more obvious from a design standpoint, but it&amp;rsquo;s the kind of thing you need to learn first hand or have previous experience, i guess anyway, after questioning the entire health orb mechanic now that healing inventory items work, i came to the conclusion the drop conditions should just be adjusted.</description>

      <description>worked on a sunday that was probably a mistake feel okay anyway, i like the script i wrote
after posting it here, it looks like the entire for loop is unnecessary, after adding in the ValueChanged function maybe i should just keep it as a sort of insurance policy?</description>

      <description>got the UI for the shop system&amp;rsquo;s buy function pretty much locked down, anchors work for stretching screen width and everything. still need to do the sell portion and write all the functionality, of course; but i feel more confident about it now overall for some reason getting to the point i am now, confounded me for two entire days last week and worried me all weekend.</description>
