      <description>reintroduced the coding for difficulty setting and programmed a play time clock, so that I can finally see how long the gameplay itself is added the ticker to the menu and save file displays, although doing so required rebuilding a bit of the player&amp;rsquo;s prefab and animator graph.</description>

      <description>something I did broke the save system, not really sure what exactly, so I&amp;rsquo;ve backed everything up as it was broken and am restoring last week&amp;rsquo;s backup, which seems to work.</description>

      <description>after a bit of first hand experience during my time away from the project with difficulty level, I have decided that a traditional system is indeed needed for my own game.</description>

      <description>it had been awhile since I modeled a human from scratch, so I started one to use as the final boss; shake things up a bit from the machines. progress is going smoothly, mainly because my references seem to be well crafted added a skip button for the dialogue, in case people like to die quickly and numerously.</description>

      <description>what a rough day i remember it being tricky to go back and forth between scripting backend types (mono, IL2CPP) and needing the internet to do so, but I don&amp;rsquo;t recall having so many problems!</description>

      <description>spent the whole week painting textures and creating shaders for the big attack for the primary attack of the second boss. had some issues with photoshop&amp;rsquo;s recognition of my wacom tablets pressure sensitivity, it was weird and I could have swore it was working.</description>

      <guid>https://aaronswindell.com/2022/02/22/boss-ship-2-rigged/</guid>
      <description>finally started setting up the second boss, it is tougher going than I had anticipated. for whatever reason, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I gave as much consideration beforehand to exactly how this particular boss would articulate what its possible attack patterns may be I then began to realise I hadn&amp;rsquo;t decided where either of the remaining two boss&amp;rsquo; weaknesses were going to be located either.</description>

      <description>have only been able to manage to be productive every other week or so. today was the first day i felt like I worked a real day all year the terrain for planet 3 is almost done after around one full day&amp;rsquo;s work, just the baking left to do, but I have many adjustments that are still pending testing still really difficult to make myself play the game to test things.</description>

      <description>have been doing terrible, but slowly getting back in the swing of things fixed a few bugs this week that weren&amp;rsquo;t game breaking and as such have been lingering around for a year or more.</description>

      <description>so, i didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything today, but the rest of the week has been most productive! i&amp;rsquo;m talking big bugs with single lines; it feels like the home stretch, but honestly it looks halfway there.</description>

      <description>haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to force myself to work on the game for quite some time, have been on a sort of hiatus added changes to correct the energy ability items/shield ability bug, as well as fixed the energy meter spending and shield ability consumption added reset trigger parameter to player animator controller to facilitate the above basically, the animator Rebind function was resetting the animator parameters too, which i use for the shield ability.</description>

      <description>finished laying out the base colors for boss ship 3 in zbrush, still need to paint the decals and decimate also think the weapon effect system is working, managed to figure out a way to set the default effect when unequipping a weapon altogether, which of course wasn&amp;rsquo;t as difficult of a problem as it seemed to be, once i had written the code supposed to test the stage progression system a bit this weekend, maybe i should add in a third type first&amp;hellip; it is good to be feeling motivated again!</description>

      <description>life is so difficult to navigate lately&amp;hellip; this is coming from someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t go anywhere or do anything except live his pursuit i am either on the cusp of something brilliant, some huge revelation or new threshold of understanding; or at the edge of some immeasurable disaster, a great unravelling of everything i have known or built and perhaps disillusion of everything that may ever come to be it is tough to say, maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna label it, or speak the thought into existence progress is coming along well on the seventh spaceship.</description>

      <description>feeling rather unproductive, but slowly trudging along&amp;hellip; been learning about and implementing preprocessor directives as i finish off the massive stage progression system update and world section integration, which i am still hoping will work out okay in the end; it seems to be so far the preprocessor clauses should prevent a bit of user (developer?</description>

      <description>i guess the machine learning seminar i took got me thinking started playing with the ML-Agents package in Unity. idk if I am hoping I can somehow program robots to finish the game for me, or if I am just bored and needed some new influx of input it is definitely intriguing and I&amp;rsquo;m surprised how quickly the agents could outperform me.</description>

      <description>i feel like i&amp;rsquo;ve lost weeks! in actuality, it&amp;rsquo;s probably been about a week&amp;hellip; in total, over the course of several weeks, but i still feel behind i&amp;rsquo;ve done numerous things and added functionality that has been on my list for a long time, but i feel like i&amp;rsquo;m really just avoiding the most pressing concern of modeling more stuff, namely the second boss i did add models for different ore items for selling and did some further delving into the shader graph, to get a more appealing metallic material with just a bit of fresnel from the graph.</description>

      <description>two steps forward and three steps back. seems like every time i fix something, i break it later. why must this be? more problems unequipping things&amp;hellip; at least i finally replicated the issue; it will only occur on the first stage.</description>

      <description>the level complete screen now displays loot obtained during the level, it seems to work. the list of lootObtained is in the Playercontroller class and it gets reset in both the Save/ResetStageGrowth methods.</description>

      <description>you&amp;rsquo;d think this sort if thing would be more obvious from a design standpoint, but it&amp;rsquo;s the kind of thing you need to learn first hand or have previous experience, i guess anyway, after questioning the entire health orb mechanic now that healing inventory items work, i came to the conclusion the drop conditions should just be adjusted.</description>

      <description>worked on a sunday that was probably a mistake feel okay anyway, i like the script i wrote
after posting it here, it looks like the entire for loop is unnecessary, after adding in the ValueChanged function maybe i should just keep it as a sort of insurance policy?</description>

      <description>got the UI for the shop system&amp;rsquo;s buy function pretty much locked down, anchors work for stretching screen width and everything. still need to do the sell portion and write all the functionality, of course; but i feel more confident about it now overall for some reason getting to the point i am now, confounded me for two entire days last week and worried me all weekend.</description>
