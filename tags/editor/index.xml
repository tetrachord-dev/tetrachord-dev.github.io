      <description>reintroduced the coding for difficulty setting and programmed a play time clock, so that I can finally see how long the gameplay itself is added the ticker to the menu and save file displays, although doing so required rebuilding a bit of the player&amp;rsquo;s prefab and animator graph.</description>

      <description>something I did broke the save system, not really sure what exactly, so I&amp;rsquo;ve backed everything up as it was broken and am restoring last week&amp;rsquo;s backup, which seems to work.</description>

      <description>what a rough day i remember it being tricky to go back and forth between scripting backend types (mono, IL2CPP) and needing the internet to do so, but I don&amp;rsquo;t recall having so many problems!</description>

      <description>so, i didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything today, but the rest of the week has been most productive! i&amp;rsquo;m talking big bugs with single lines; it feels like the home stretch, but honestly it looks halfway there.</description>

      <description>you&amp;rsquo;d think this sort if thing would be more obvious from a design standpoint, but it&amp;rsquo;s the kind of thing you need to learn first hand or have previous experience, i guess anyway, after questioning the entire health orb mechanic now that healing inventory items work, i came to the conclusion the drop conditions should just be adjusted.</description>
