      <description>reintroduced the coding for difficulty setting and programmed a play time clock, so that I can finally see how long the gameplay itself is added the ticker to the menu and save file displays, although doing so required rebuilding a bit of the player&amp;rsquo;s prefab and animator graph.</description>

      <description>was feeling the typical Sunday Sadness, so I fired up the PC to try and catch up on some of the work from last week I was planning on redoing this week.</description>

      <description>something I did broke the save system, not really sure what exactly, so I&amp;rsquo;ve backed everything up as it was broken and am restoring last week&amp;rsquo;s backup, which seems to work.</description>

      <description>after a bit of first hand experience during my time away from the project with difficulty level, I have decided that a traditional system is indeed needed for my own game.</description>

      <description>it had been awhile since I modeled a human from scratch, so I started one to use as the final boss; shake things up a bit from the machines. progress is going smoothly, mainly because my references seem to be well crafted added a skip button for the dialogue, in case people like to die quickly and numerously.</description>

      <description>what feels like an endless endeavour is slowly grinding along. better late than never, at least that&amp;rsquo;s what they say. finally published the second demo to the Google Play app store for internal testing phase 2.</description>

      <description>finally started setting up the second boss, it is tougher going than I had anticipated. for whatever reason, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I gave as much consideration beforehand to exactly how this particular boss would articulate what its possible attack patterns may be I then began to realise I hadn&amp;rsquo;t decided where either of the remaining two boss&amp;rsquo; weaknesses were going to be located either.</description>

      <description>have been doing terrible, but slowly getting back in the swing of things fixed a few bugs this week that weren&amp;rsquo;t game breaking and as such have been lingering around for a year or more.</description>

      <description>finished laying out the base colors for boss ship 3 in zbrush, still need to paint the decals and decimate also think the weapon effect system is working, managed to figure out a way to set the default effect when unequipping a weapon altogether, which of course wasn&amp;rsquo;t as difficult of a problem as it seemed to be, once i had written the code supposed to test the stage progression system a bit this weekend, maybe i should add in a third type first&amp;hellip; it is good to be feeling motivated again!</description>

      <description>life is so difficult to navigate lately&amp;hellip; this is coming from someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t go anywhere or do anything except live his pursuit i am either on the cusp of something brilliant, some huge revelation or new threshold of understanding; or at the edge of some immeasurable disaster, a great unravelling of everything i have known or built and perhaps disillusion of everything that may ever come to be it is tough to say, maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna label it, or speak the thought into existence progress is coming along well on the seventh spaceship.</description>

      <description>feeling rather unproductive, but slowly trudging along&amp;hellip; been learning about and implementing preprocessor directives as i finish off the massive stage progression system update and world section integration, which i am still hoping will work out okay in the end; it seems to be so far the preprocessor clauses should prevent a bit of user (developer?</description>

      <description>finally got what i am hoping to be the major changes involved in this &amp;ldquo;huge rewrite&amp;rdquo; completed and have started testing. lots and lots of notes/bugs already, it is hard to feel like i am making progress, but these things should have been this way from the start.</description>

      <description>i guess the machine learning seminar i took got me thinking started playing with the ML-Agents package in Unity. idk if I am hoping I can somehow program robots to finish the game for me, or if I am just bored and needed some new influx of input it is definitely intriguing and I&amp;rsquo;m surprised how quickly the agents could outperform me.</description>

      <description>been working on the boss ship 2 model, hi-res almost done changed out my learning.regiment from Unity&amp;rsquo;s artificial intelligence course to an intro to the ML-Agents package, the hummingbirds. it seems to incorporate new solutions to traditional AI problems, which should keep my brain seeking and growing, while potentially finding some new behavior for an enemy or possibly balancing out some mechanics for the game time will tell, but i feel the influx of new ideas, practices and technologies to be crucial to developing</description>

      <description>i feel like i&amp;rsquo;ve lost weeks! in actuality, it&amp;rsquo;s probably been about a week&amp;hellip; in total, over the course of several weeks, but i still feel behind i&amp;rsquo;ve done numerous things and added functionality that has been on my list for a long time, but i feel like i&amp;rsquo;m really just avoiding the most pressing concern of modeling more stuff, namely the second boss i did add models for different ore items for selling and did some further delving into the shader graph, to get a more appealing metallic material with just a bit of fresnel from the graph.</description>

      <description>added logic for resetting the player&amp;rsquo;s inventory/equipment on death to the state it was when the stage began my first thoughts were to add the items consumed to a list when used, then add them back into the inventory on retry, but through further consideration i realised there would be issues with equipment and that i should probably save/restore that along with the inventory.</description>

      <description>worked on a sunday that was probably a mistake feel okay anyway, i like the script i wrote
after posting it here, it looks like the entire for loop is unnecessary, after adding in the ValueChanged function maybe i should just keep it as a sort of insurance policy?</description>
