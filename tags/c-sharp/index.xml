      <description>feeling rather unproductive, but slowly trudging along&amp;hellip; been learning about and implementing preprocessor directives as i finish off the massive stage progression system update and world section integration, which i am still hoping will work out okay in the end; it seems to be so far the preprocessor clauses should prevent a bit of user (developer?</description>

      <description>finally got what i am hoping to be the major changes involved in this &amp;ldquo;huge rewrite&amp;rdquo; completed and have started testing. lots and lots of notes/bugs already, it is hard to feel like i am making progress, but these things should have been this way from the start.</description>

      <description>making everything the way it should have always been. am learning a lot and also realizing how much i have already.
you know you wrote some sexy code, when what you added to the code base is less than you removed and it does MORE stuff&amp;hellip; the stuff you really want</description>

      <description>i guess the machine learning seminar i took got me thinking started playing with the ML-Agents package in Unity. idk if I am hoping I can somehow program robots to finish the game for me, or if I am just bored and needed some new influx of input it is definitely intriguing and I&amp;rsquo;m surprised how quickly the agents could outperform me.</description>

      <description>been working on the boss ship 2 model, hi-res almost done changed out my learning.regiment from Unity&amp;rsquo;s artificial intelligence course to an intro to the ML-Agents package, the hummingbirds. it seems to incorporate new solutions to traditional AI problems, which should keep my brain seeking and growing, while potentially finding some new behavior for an enemy or possibly balancing out some mechanics for the game time will tell, but i feel the influx of new ideas, practices and technologies to be crucial to developing</description>

      <description>i feel like i&amp;rsquo;ve lost weeks! in actuality, it&amp;rsquo;s probably been about a week&amp;hellip; in total, over the course of several weeks, but i still feel behind i&amp;rsquo;ve done numerous things and added functionality that has been on my list for a long time, but i feel like i&amp;rsquo;m really just avoiding the most pressing concern of modeling more stuff, namely the second boss i did add models for different ore items for selling and did some further delving into the shader graph, to get a more appealing metallic material with just a bit of fresnel from the graph.</description>

      <description>two steps forward and three steps back. seems like every time i fix something, i break it later. why must this be? more problems unequipping things&amp;hellip; at least i finally replicated the issue; it will only occur on the first stage.</description>

      <description>the level complete screen now displays loot obtained during the level, it seems to work. the list of lootObtained is in the Playercontroller class and it gets reset in both the Save/ResetStageGrowth methods.</description>

      <description>added logic for resetting the player&amp;rsquo;s inventory/equipment on death to the state it was when the stage began my first thoughts were to add the items consumed to a list when used, then add them back into the inventory on retry, but through further consideration i realised there would be issues with equipment and that i should probably save/restore that along with the inventory.</description>

      <description>entered another phase of indecision shop system seems to work, although it still needs UI animation the gameplay itself also needs balancing; to address this i have begun leaning on my favorite pillar of design philosophy, research!</description>

      <description>i guess it was bugging the crap out of me, no pun intended, so i ended up fixing the inventory issue i was having in build turns out, for whatever reason the old saveData was invalid.</description>

      <description>i guess the shop is now in alpha stage, ready for testing. it still needs animation, but that will come with beta. buying and selling seem to work had problems serializing a list of item class, then i realised that its normal, i guess?</description>

      <description>worked on a sunday that was probably a mistake feel okay anyway, i like the script i wrote
after posting it here, it looks like the entire for loop is unnecessary, after adding in the ValueChanged function maybe i should just keep it as a sort of insurance policy?</description>
