      <description>after a bit of first hand experience during my time away from the project with difficulty level, I have decided that a traditional system is indeed needed for my own game.</description>

      <description>it had been awhile since I modeled a human from scratch, so I started one to use as the final boss; shake things up a bit from the machines. progress is going smoothly, mainly because my references seem to be well crafted added a skip button for the dialogue, in case people like to die quickly and numerously.</description>

      <description>two or three days of depression, so I&amp;rsquo;m working on a holiday. at least it is my least favorite one, maybe second to new year&amp;rsquo;s, i suppose didn&amp;rsquo;t really do much.</description>

      <description>spent the whole week painting textures and creating shaders for the big attack for the primary attack of the second boss. had some issues with photoshop&amp;rsquo;s recognition of my wacom tablets pressure sensitivity, it was weird and I could have swore it was working.</description>

      <description>finally started setting up the second boss, it is tougher going than I had anticipated. for whatever reason, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I gave as much consideration beforehand to exactly how this particular boss would articulate what its possible attack patterns may be I then began to realise I hadn&amp;rsquo;t decided where either of the remaining two boss&amp;rsquo; weaknesses were going to be located either.</description>

      <description>have only been able to manage to be productive every other week or so. today was the first day i felt like I worked a real day all year the terrain for planet 3 is almost done after around one full day&amp;rsquo;s work, just the baking left to do, but I have many adjustments that are still pending testing still really difficult to make myself play the game to test things.</description>

      <description>i changed like a million things to fix a hundred&amp;hellip; if that isn&amp;rsquo;t a saying, quote me. idk what to even test anymore december I am supposed to add all these people&amp;hellip; the weapon change system seems good&amp;hellip; recent adjustments to equipment strength seems appropriate&amp;hellip; i need to figure out the relic/accessories, the ability system&amp;hellip; what am I missing?</description>

      <description>today i modeled and rendered a blaster icon in an hour and a half&amp;hellip; stark contrast to the circuit board, but it was a pretty simple model.</description>

      <description>started retopologising boss ship 3 and i actually figured out a way to see the vertex color data from zbrush in Maya, which should make the process a bit more friendly and eliminate the use of TopoGun altogether.</description>

      <description>my birthday vacation seems to have inadvertently become a summer stay, either that or I&amp;rsquo;ve reached a slump. slowly, but surely i am finding fresh motive to continue.
there was a bit of a temporary detour in attempt to get better internet infrastructure in my home, but in the end my efforts have proven fruitless.</description>

      <title>spaceship 07 final low resolution model</title>

      <guid>https://aaronswindell.com/2021/04/03/spaceship-07-final-low-resolution-model/</guid>
      <description>ended up swapping to Maya halfway through retopologizing this model. sections started to get really close together, even having tried to eliminate such areas in the modeling stage i feel as though i have discovered this before, but the new Maya modeling toolkit is actually better than using TopoGun.</description>

      <description>finished up the high resolution model sculpting and vertex colouring in zBrush, got the model decimated and have started laying out the final topology in topogun
had some strange issues merging subtools in z&amp;hellip; ended up reloading a save to find a piece disappearing and reappearing, sort of flickering as the camera would rotate.</description>

      <description>life is so difficult to navigate lately&amp;hellip; this is coming from someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t go anywhere or do anything except live his pursuit i am either on the cusp of something brilliant, some huge revelation or new threshold of understanding; or at the edge of some immeasurable disaster, a great unravelling of everything i have known or built and perhaps disillusion of everything that may ever come to be it is tough to say, maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna label it, or speak the thought into existence progress is coming along well on the seventh spaceship.</description>

      <description>finished the hummingbirds course. also completed the decimation/export process from zBrush and got the low-res model going. managed to use some of the old topology from spaceShip 5, so have a decent start not sure why i feel like i didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything, that sounds productive doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?</description>

      <description>finished the hi-res painting and sculpting for the second boss ship model. i have gotten a decent collection of generic alpha shapes over the course of this project and am getting used to using zremesher on everything i need to paint on monday i plan to decimate the model and begin topology construction to get the poly count of the final low-res mesh as low as possible.</description>

      <description>i think i need to start documenting more things in this log&amp;hellip;
working on the second terrain and i realised i couldn&amp;rsquo;t really remember the exact workflow i used, just a couple notes on the polygon count that were actually misleading after digging into the old project files.</description>
