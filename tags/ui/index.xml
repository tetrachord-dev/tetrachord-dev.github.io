      <description>worked on a sunday that was probably a mistake feel okay anyway, i like the script i wrote
after posting it here, it looks like the entire for loop is unnecessary, after adding in the ValueChanged function maybe i should just keep it as a sort of insurance policy?</description>

      <description>got the UI for the shop system&amp;rsquo;s buy function pretty much locked down, anchors work for stretching screen width and everything. still need to do the sell portion and write all the functionality, of course; but i feel more confident about it now overall for some reason getting to the point i am now, confounded me for two entire days last week and worried me all weekend.</description>
