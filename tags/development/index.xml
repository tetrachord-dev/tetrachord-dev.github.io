      <description>reintroduced the coding for difficulty setting and programmed a play time clock, so that I can finally see how long the gameplay itself is added the ticker to the menu and save file displays, although doing so required rebuilding a bit of the player&amp;rsquo;s prefab and animator graph.</description>

      <description>what a rough day i remember it being tricky to go back and forth between scripting backend types (mono, IL2CPP) and needing the internet to do so, but I don&amp;rsquo;t recall having so many problems!</description>

      <description>no, seriously&amp;hellip; i think this might help all of it needs to be done anyhow mayhap a month of dreary upkeep and a return to the masses of the online roleplayers be just what the doctor ordered i should real quick build a three kit kill version for test play during this time, the level progression values as is are definitely off-putting</description>

      <description>i managed to complete Google Play&amp;rsquo;s data safety form within a day, despite my initial expectations of its difficulty. in the end, it was just a matter of hunkering down and doing it.</description>

      <description>i am formally declaring (announcing?) the conclusion of operation: octo-squid. while the operation&amp;rsquo;s primary objectives will remain in place, i feel that the short-term goal the regimen was put in place to achieve has been accomplished for the time being.</description>

      <description>i can feel the pangs of art beginning to return after a month or so of respite. i think i shall try to ease myself back into the actual creative parts by working on some practical aspects, that have been neglected as of late, to begin.</description>

      <description>so, i didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything today, but the rest of the week has been most productive! i&amp;rsquo;m talking big bugs with single lines; it feels like the home stretch, but honestly it looks halfway there.</description>
