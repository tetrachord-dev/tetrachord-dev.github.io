      <description>started retopologising boss ship 3 and i actually figured out a way to see the vertex color data from zbrush in Maya, which should make the process a bit more friendly and eliminate the use of TopoGun altogether.</description>

      <title>spaceship 07 final low resolution model</title>

      <description>ended up swapping to Maya halfway through retopologizing this model. sections started to get really close together, even having tried to eliminate such areas in the modeling stage i feel as though i have discovered this before, but the new Maya modeling toolkit is actually better than using TopoGun.</description>

      <description>finished up the high resolution model sculpting and vertex colouring in zBrush, got the model decimated and have started laying out the final topology in topogun
had some strange issues merging subtools in z&amp;hellip; ended up reloading a save to find a piece disappearing and reappearing, sort of flickering as the camera would rotate.</description>

      <description>still need to get the count down a bit and lay out the UVs in Maya, then texture and a tiny bit of rigging</description>

      <description>almost finished the final low resolution model within the year, tired of clicking. gonna look back and see what i was working on a year ago, exactly. hopefully doesn&amp;rsquo;t make me too sad, hahah</description>

      <description>finished the hummingbirds course. also completed the decimation/export process from zBrush and got the low-res model going. managed to use some of the old topology from spaceShip 5, so have a decent start not sure why i feel like i didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything, that sounds productive doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?</description>

      <description>i am writing this the morning of the fourth day actually, topology always takes more time than i plan for. i managed to get the model itself done, but it is still lacking UVWs the plan for today is just to get them done, maybe i will make it as far as to bring the model into substance painter to bake the base maps and check for projection errors.</description>

      <description>currently stopped again from thunder, model approximately 2/3 done. i wonder how much concern is warranted and how much is paranoia in regard to lightning frying electronics i keep reminding myself to just get the mesh out as quickly as possible and that i will still optimize it in maya before laying out the UVW, but it is hard to altogether keep myself from considering topology.</description>

      <description>didn&amp;rsquo;t have a ton of time to work today, about a third of the way through the model spent yesterday decimating everything and exporting different detail levels from zBrush</description>
