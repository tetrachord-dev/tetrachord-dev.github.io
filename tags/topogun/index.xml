      <description>still need to get the count down a bit and lay out the UVs in Maya, then texture and a tiny bit of rigging</description>

      <description>finished the hummingbirds course. also completed the decimation/export process from zBrush and got the low-res model going. managed to use some of the old topology from spaceShip 5, so have a decent start not sure why i feel like i didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything, that sounds productive doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?</description>

      <description>i am writing this the morning of the fourth day actually, topology always takes more time than i plan for. i managed to get the model itself done, but it is still lacking UVWs the plan for today is just to get them done, maybe i will make it as far as to bring the model into substance painter to bake the base maps and check for projection errors.</description>

      <description>currently stopped again from thunder, model approximately 2/3 done. i wonder how much concern is warranted and how much is paranoia in regard to lightning frying electronics i keep reminding myself to just get the mesh out as quickly as possible and that i will still optimize it in maya before laying out the UVW, but it is hard to altogether keep myself from considering topology.</description>

      <description>didn&amp;rsquo;t have a ton of time to work today, about a third of the way through the model spent yesterday decimating everything and exporting different detail levels from zBrush</description>
