      <description>finished the hummingbirds course. also completed the decimation/export process from zBrush and got the low-res model going. managed to use some of the old topology from spaceShip 5, so have a decent start not sure why i feel like i didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything, that sounds productive doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?</description>

      <description>finished the hi-res painting and sculpting for the second boss ship model. i have gotten a decent collection of generic alpha shapes over the course of this project and am getting used to using zremesher on everything i need to paint on monday i plan to decimate the model and begin topology construction to get the poly count of the final low-res mesh as low as possible.</description>

      <description>i think i need to start documenting more things in this log&amp;hellip;
working on the second terrain and i realised i couldn&amp;rsquo;t really remember the exact workflow i used, just a couple notes on the polygon count that were actually misleading after digging into the old project files.</description>

      <description>with the majority of yesterday lost to thunder and a surprise visitor, it was somewhat annoying to have another thunderous day in south Florida. i ended up back on track rather than ahead of schedule.</description>

      <description>still a few more details to sculpt before painting the vertex color tomorrow and decimating for export. should be able to get it done and start retopolgising Friday, putting me about a day ahead of my schedule&amp;hellip; still don&amp;rsquo;t see having it done quicker than my normal two weeks, but meh</description>

      <description>got the ship into zBrush and have started remeshing the pieces i need to sculpt/paint on; the sound of looming thunder has thwarted my progress once more, for now. i can definitely feel my years of experience paying off with zBrush.</description>
