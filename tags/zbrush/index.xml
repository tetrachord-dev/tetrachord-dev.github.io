      <description>two or three days of depression, so I&amp;rsquo;m working on a holiday. at least it is my least favorite one, maybe second to new year&amp;rsquo;s, i suppose didn&amp;rsquo;t really do much.</description>

      <description>started retopologising boss ship 3 and i actually figured out a way to see the vertex color data from zbrush in Maya, which should make the process a bit more friendly and eliminate the use of TopoGun altogether.</description>

      <description>starting the week out well, productivity apps seem to be helping me be aware of and provide accountability for my time. had to do a tiny bit of sculpting to reshape a few parts, i thought i was done with it at least twice, but kept finding details i missed.</description>

      <description>finished laying out the base colors for boss ship 3 in zbrush, still need to paint the decals and decimate also think the weapon effect system is working, managed to figure out a way to set the default effect when unequipping a weapon altogether, which of course wasn&amp;rsquo;t as difficult of a problem as it seemed to be, once i had written the code supposed to test the stage progression system a bit this weekend, maybe i should add in a third type first&amp;hellip; it is good to be feeling motivated again!</description>

      <description>actually opened up zbrush this week and got the model imported, the project started. also, started work on the weapon effect system was harder than expected to get a prototype working.</description>

      <description>finished up the high resolution model sculpting and vertex colouring in zBrush, got the model decimated and have started laying out the final topology in topogun
had some strange issues merging subtools in z&amp;hellip; ended up reloading a save to find a piece disappearing and reappearing, sort of flickering as the camera would rotate.</description>

      <description>life is so difficult to navigate lately&amp;hellip; this is coming from someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t go anywhere or do anything except live his pursuit i am either on the cusp of something brilliant, some huge revelation or new threshold of understanding; or at the edge of some immeasurable disaster, a great unravelling of everything i have known or built and perhaps disillusion of everything that may ever come to be it is tough to say, maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna label it, or speak the thought into existence progress is coming along well on the seventh spaceship.</description>

      <description>finished the hummingbirds course. also completed the decimation/export process from zBrush and got the low-res model going. managed to use some of the old topology from spaceShip 5, so have a decent start not sure why i feel like i didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything, that sounds productive doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?</description>

      <description>finished the hi-res painting and sculpting for the second boss ship model. i have gotten a decent collection of generic alpha shapes over the course of this project and am getting used to using zremesher on everything i need to paint on monday i plan to decimate the model and begin topology construction to get the poly count of the final low-res mesh as low as possible.</description>

      <description>i think i need to start documenting more things in this log&amp;hellip;
working on the second terrain and i realised i couldn&amp;rsquo;t really remember the exact workflow i used, just a couple notes on the polygon count that were actually misleading after digging into the old project files.</description>

      <description>with the majority of yesterday lost to thunder and a surprise visitor, it was somewhat annoying to have another thunderous day in south Florida. i ended up back on track rather than ahead of schedule.</description>

      <description>still a few more details to sculpt before painting the vertex color tomorrow and decimating for export. should be able to get it done and start retopolgising Friday, putting me about a day ahead of my schedule&amp;hellip; still don&amp;rsquo;t see having it done quicker than my normal two weeks, but meh</description>

      <description>got the ship into zBrush and have started remeshing the pieces i need to sculpt/paint on; the sound of looming thunder has thwarted my progress once more, for now. i can definitely feel my years of experience paying off with zBrush.</description>
