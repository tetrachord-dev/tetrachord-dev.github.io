      <description>finished texturing the third boss ship model in substance painter and exported the textures. still need to setup the shaders and do the final FBX export from Maya i can&amp;rsquo;t decide if i want to continue to do the attack animations in Unity, or go a bit ahead and learn the animation and rigging pipeline, so i would already have it under my belt when i go to animate a humanoid character or anything else with a complex rig hierarchy i&amp;rsquo;d obviously want to animate in Maya hmm, indeed</description>

      <description>i think i need to start documenting more things in this log&amp;hellip;
working on the second terrain and i realised i couldn&amp;rsquo;t really remember the exact workflow i used, just a couple notes on the polygon count that were actually misleading after digging into the old project files.</description>
